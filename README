This repository contains demo application which is build using ActionStreetMap framework. More information can be found here: http://actionstreetmap.github.io/demo

Upcoming changes in framework:
	v0.2
		• Reimplemented logic of processing map data (use custom spatial index inside)
		• Reimplemented logic of interpolating height map for elevation mode (use bilinear interpolation)
		• Added support flat map mode (rendering is faster in ~30%, no need in elevation data)
		• Fixed issues with missing elements crossing tile borders (limitation of old map data processing logic)
		• Added simple search for elements with given tag's key/value pair (limitation of old map data processing logic)
		• Smart road processing (build road graph, detect road junctions to simplify further AI logic)
	
	v0.3
		• Switch to usage of Reactive Extensions (Rx) unity port
		• Non UI thread blocking and async tile loading by Rx
