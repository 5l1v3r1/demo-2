        <a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-asm" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's Action Street Map?</h3>

          
		<p>Action Street Map (ASM) is an engine for building real city environment dynamically using  <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/"> OSM (Open Street Map) </a> data. 
		  <br> It works pretty simple; you download the map data from Open Street Maps, provide it to the <a href="https://github.com/ActionStreetMap/framework">engine</a> and voila! 
		  It generates you a 3D environment with almost every data available on the map; buildings, roads, traffic lights, bus stops etc. </p>
		  
		  
		 <p> After getting your real 3D city environment (maybe your neighbourhood) than sky is the limit. 
		 Since it's in <a href="http://unity3d.com/ ">unity</a>, you can port it to almost every platform. 
		 Build a game based on ASM engine, that can run on mobile, web and desktop. 
		 You can even go further and build a Virtual Reality environment of your neighbourhood using the engine. 
		 Although you can create pretty nice 3D city for your own use; the engine is not flawless and it's in alpha stage. 
		 There are a lot to be done and we need contributors. </p>
		 
		 <p> Below is an example screenshot from Moscow, Red Square (outdated, read information below). <p>
          <a href="demo_list.html"><img src="images/Moscow_redsquare.png" class="inner" /></a>

		  
		  
          <p>The main goal is to simulate a real city, including following options:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>rendering of different models (e.g. buildings, roads, parks, rivers, etc.) using OSM data for given location and using terrain tiling approach (DONE partially)</li>
              <li>rendering of non-flat world by using Data Elevation Model (DEM) files (DONE partially)</li>
              <li>adding a character to the scene, which makes it capable to interact with the environment (DONE partially)</li>
              <li>filling environment with people, cars, animals, which have realistic behaviour (Not started)</li>
              <li>using some external services to extend environment (e.g. weather, famous places, events, public transport schedule, etc.) (Not started)</li>
              <li>Multiplayer (Not started)</li>

          </ul>

           
          <p>NOTE: Project is still in alpha stage! There are too many things to be done and many ways to contribute to this project. We appreciate any kind of contribution. </p>

		  <h3>Upcoming changes in framework:</h3>
			Future version of framework will use flat shading style (work in progress):
			<img src="images/FlatShading_Pic1.png" class="inner" />
			<img src="images/FlatShading_Pic2.png" class="inner" />
			Current progress (will be updated):
			<ul>
				<li>Reimplemented logic of processing map data: use custom spatial index inside and no need to use splitter tool.</li>
				<li>Added import support of o5m, xml and pbf formats.</li>
				<li>Reimplemented logic of interpolating height map for elevation mode: it's more accurate now (bilinear interpolation is used).</li>
				<li>Added support flat map mode: rendering is faster in ~30% and no need in elevation data.</li>
				<li>Fixed issues with missing elements crossing tile borders: limitation of old map data processing logic.</li>
				<li>Added simple search for elements with given tag's key/value pair: you can find the nearest bars, places, etc.</li>
				<li>Switched to usage of Reactive Extensions (Rx) unity port: now support async processing.</li>
				<li>Async loading by Rx: dynamically load tile without blocking UI thread.</li>
				<li>Made flat shading be default show case style.</li>
				<li>Implemented custom mesh terrain instead of unity built-in to support flat shading style.</li>
				<li>Reimplemented road rendering approach.</li>
			</ul>
