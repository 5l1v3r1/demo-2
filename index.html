		<p>Action Street Map (ASM) is an engine for building real city environment dynamically using  <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/"> OSM (Open Street Map) </a> data. 
		  <br> It works pretty simple; you download the map data from Open Street Maps, provide it to the engine and voila! 
		  It generates you a 3D environment with almost every data available on the map; buildings, roads, traffic lights, bus stops etc. </p>
		  
		  
		 <p> After getting your real 3D city environment (maybe your neighbourhood) than sky is the limit. 
		 Since it's in <a href="http://unity3d.com/ ">unity</a>, you can port it to almost every platform. 
		 Build a game based on ASM engine, that can run on mobile, web and desktop. 
		 You can even go further and build a Virtual Reality environment of your neighbourhood using the engine. 
		 Although you can create pretty nice 3D city for your own use; the engine is not flawless and it's in alpha stage. 
		 There are a lot to be done and we need contributors. </p>
		 
		 <p> Below is an example screenshot from Moscow, Red Square. <p>
          <a href="demo_list.html"><img src="images/Moscow_redsquare.png" class="inner" /></a>

		  
		  
          <p>The main goal is to simulate a real city, including following options:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>rendering of different models (e.g. buildings, roads, parks, rivers, etc.) using OSM data for given location and using terrain tiling approach (DONE partially)</li>
              <li>rendering of non-flat world by using Data Elevation Model (DEM) files (DONE partially)</li>
              <li>adding a character to the scene, which makes it capable to interact with the environment (DONE partially)</li>
              <li>filling environment with people, cars, animals, which have realistic behaviour (Not started)</li>
              <li>using some external services to extend environment (e.g. weather, famous places, events, public transport schedule, etc.) (Not started)</li>
              <li>Multiplayer (Not started)</li>

          </ul>

           
          <p>NOTE: Project is still in alpha stage! There are too many things to be done and many ways to contribute to this project. We appreciate any kind of contribution. </p>

          <ul>
            
                  <ol>
                      <li>Download pbf file of desired place from any source (e.g. <a href="http://download.geofabrik.de">geofabrik</a>) </li>
                      <li> Split it using splitter tool. This tool splits big osm file to smaller ones and creates index file which helps to increase performance.</li>
                      <p>
                          NOTE: this tool is committed to project repository: Tools\Splitter. Please read the corresponding README file. Actually, all you need is to run bat file with arguments.
                          Newest version of original tool can be downloaded <a href="http://www.mkgmap.org.uk/download/splitter.html">here</a>.
                      </p>
                      <li>
                          Download elevation data file (SRTM) of given area from <a href="http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3">here</a> and unpack it.
                          <p>NOTE: probably, you have to change y-position of your character in editor before launch. it depends on elevation in your place.</p>
                          <p>NOTE: Later, this step can be skipped as ASM will support "flat world" mode.</p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                          Modify Assets\Resources\Config\settings.json config:
                          <ul>
                              <li>"mapdata" should be set to folder which contains split result of pbf file.</li>
                              <li>"elevationdata" should be set to folder which contains downloaded SRTM files with .hgt extension</li>
                              <li>"position" should be set to geo coordinate of desired place</li>
                          </ul>
                      </li>
